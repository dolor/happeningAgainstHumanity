## Happening against Humanity
Happening against Humanity is a politically very incorrect game that is not suited for children, families, or people who are offended by anything. At all. It is, however, a very fun game to play with some friends who don't care too much about any of that!

## Black and White cards
The game has 2 types of cards: The black (question) cards, and the white (answer) cards.
- After each round, any player can start the next round by drawing a black card. A black card usually has a blank in the question/sentence (\_\_\_\_\_), or is simply a question.
- At the start of the game, everyone gets 10 white cards, and after playing any you can draw white cards until you have a full hand again. You use these white cards to complete or answer the black cards.

## Gameplay
Each round consists of 2 phases: Playing and Voting.

- After a black card has been drawn, everyone plays a white card that he or she thinks is the funniest way to complete or answer the black card.
- After either everyone has played their cards, or a certain time passes, the game moves on to the 'voting round'. During voting, everyone can select his favorite white card(s) from the cards all other players played. The result of the voting is shown after everyone has cast their votes or, again, everyone voted.
- If the black card says 'Play 2', this means that you have to play 2 white cards (in order) to answer or complete the black card.

The game is paused when you run out of either white or black cards. If you want to pause the game at any other moment, simply don't draw new black cards again.

## Inspiration
The game is based on the game 'Cards against Humanity', and uses its original set of cards (with some changes, with thanks to /Pretend You're Xyzzy/), which have been made available to use under the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/](Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Creative Commons license).
